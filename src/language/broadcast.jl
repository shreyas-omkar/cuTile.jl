# the implementation for overlaid ops, while Julia's native scalar functions

# operations (comparisons, ifelse) are supported by the mixed-type map methods

# nodes and indexing element-by-element in one loop), cuTile must eagerly
# materialize because Tile IR operates on whole tiles — there is no
# element-wise indexing. Two separate IR ops (e.g. mulf then addf) IS the
# correct output. The intermediate from_scalar/to_scalar pairs between
# stages are zero-cost (just CGVal type reinterpretation at codegen time).
