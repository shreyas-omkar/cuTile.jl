# NOTE: Due to JuliaLang/julia#60583, intrinsics may be called during constant evaluation.
#       Because of that, such intrinsics (such as basic arithmetic) need to provide an
#       implementation that actually computes a valid result using Julia intrinsics.
#
#       Sometimes that's not possible, e.g., because the functionality required for that is
#       overlayed by methods calling back into the intrinsic (e.g. `sin`), so for those
#       intrinsics we disable constant folding using a `compilerbarrier(:const)`
